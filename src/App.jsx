        <h3>Problem We're Solving</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Many communities struggle with effective waste disposal, leading to environmental pollution and health hazards. Organic waste often goes unused, piling up and contributing to greenhouse gas emissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Conventional energy sources are expensive and inaccessible to many rural or under-resourced communities, leaving people dependent on costly or unreliable fuel sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Many energy solutions today contribute to environmental harm. Our biogas solution transforms waste into sustainable energy, reducing reliance on fossil fuels and contributing to a cleaner environment.
